## Overview
<p style="text-align: justify"> In the complex landscape of e-commerce, our project embraced a sophisticated event-driven microservice architecture, utilizing the power of AWS EventBridge and SQS to streamline the dynamic challenges of efficiently routing, handling, and processing a vast influx of diverse state change events. These events, which encapsulate vital data regarding orders, inventories, and returns, originate from a myriad of downstream systems operating across different sellers and marketplaces. By implementing a decoupled system design, the architecture ensured scalability and resilience. Redundant API calls were dramatically reduced, optimizing system throughput and latency. Additionally, with the integration of AWS CloudWatch, we achieved granular monitoring and alerting capabilities, ensuring that the system's health and performance were consistently at their peak. This holistic approach resulted in a robust, agile, and scalable system design that catered to the ever-evolving demands of modern e-commerce platforms. </p>


## Architecture

<p style="text-align: justify"> The project's architecture is designed to ensure efficient event processing, resilience, and scalability. Here's a detailed breakdown:</p>

1. <p style="text-align: justify"><b>Event Producers</b>: Multiple downstream systems consistently push state change events, including updates related to orders, inventories, and returns for different e-commerce marketplaces and sellers.</p>

2. <p style="text-align: justify"><b>AWS EventBridge</b>: Positioned as the central hub, EventBridge seamlessly intercepts these events. Using predefined rules, it routes these events to the appropriate SQS queues, ensuring that every event reaches its intended destination.</p>

3. <p style="text-align: justify"><b>SQS Queues</b>: Serving as temporary storage and processing endpoints, these queues hold routed events until they are consumed. They guarantee that no event is lost and are designed for concurrent processing, facilitating timely event handling.</p>

4. <p style="text-align: justify"><b>SQS Consumers</b>: Distributed systems designed to process or consume events from the SQS queues. They're scalable and can be ramped up to handle high event loads, ensuring events don't languish in the queue for extended periods.</p>

5. <p style="text-align: justify"><b>Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)</b>: An essential component in our fault-tolerant design, the DLQ handles events that can't be processed after several attempts. This ensures that problematic events are isolated, examined, and dealt with, without stalling the processing of other events in the main queues.</p>

6. <p style="text-align: justify"><b>Repushing Mechanism</b>: For events that may experience temporary processing failures, our architecture has a mechanism to repush them back into the SQS queues. This ensures that transient issues don't result in event loss, and every event gets a fair chance at processing.</p>

7. <p style="text-align: justify"><b>Monitoring with CloudWatch</b>: CloudWatch provides continuous surveillance over every component of the architecture. From monitoring the health and length of SQS queues to the activity of consumers and the DLQ, CloudWatch offers insights and proactive alerts for optimal system performance.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">This architecture, with its decoupled design, ensures that the system remains resilient to failures, scalable to handle event spikes, and efficient in processing each event in a timely manner.</p>

Such an optimization meant faster response times, quicker event processing, and enhanced user experiences.</p>

2. <p style="text-align: justify"><b>Reliability Quotient</b>: With the inclusion of the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) and repushing mechanisms, the rate of successful event processing saw a significant rise. Events that previously might have been lost or ignored due to transient issues were now being captured and processed, increasing the overall reliability quotient of the system.</p>

3. <p style="text-align: justify"><b>Resource Allocation</b>: The efficient event routing and processing resulted in better resource utilization. This meant that computing resources, previously stretched thin due to redundant operations or inefficiencies, were now more focused and aptly utilized, leading to cost savings and a more optimized infrastructure footprint.</p>

4. <p style="text-align: justify"><b>Response Time</b>: The system's response time, especially in peak traffic scenarios like flash sales or promotional periods, improved noticeably. This was mainly due to the streamlined event processing, the scalability of SQS consumers, and the efficient routing via AWS EventBridge.</p>

5. <p style="text-align: justify"><b>Proactive Issue Resolution</b>: With the granular monitoring capabilities offered by AWS CloudWatch, potential bottlenecks or issues were identified and addressed in their nascent stages. This proactive approach led to a considerable reduction in system downtimes or performance hiccups.</p>

6. <p style="text-align: justify"><b>Stakeholder Feedback</b>: Both internal and external stakeholders, including sellers on the platform and end-users, reported a marked improvement in data consistency and system responsiveness. This positive feedback was a testament to the transformative impact of the new architecture on the platform's operational dynamics.</p>

7. <p style="text-align: justify"><b>Operational Resilience</b>: The architecture demonstrated exceptional resilience during stress tests, simulating high event loads or potential failure scenarios. Such resilience ensured that the platform remained operational and efficient even during unprecedented challenges or event spikes.</p>
